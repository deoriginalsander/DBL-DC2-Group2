# DBL-DC2-Group2
This project contains the model and the visualisations that were ised by our group for Data Challange 2.
It was made to assist the metropolitan police in making decisions on where to assign their officers with regard to preventing burglaries in Barnet.

There are two .py files. The 'main' file contains the model while the 'Visualisation' file contains function with our visualisations used. (They are named accordingly)
In order to run those files you need ot extract the database from the zip file in your files and import the used modules.
