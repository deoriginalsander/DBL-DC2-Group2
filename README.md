# DBL-DC2-Group2
This project contains the model and the visualisations that were ised by our group for Data Challange 2.
It was made to assist the metropolitan police in making decisions on where to assign their officers with regard to preventing burglaries in Barnet.

There are two .py files. The 'main' file consist out of two parts. the first part is where we put the data in a database and clean it. The second part is a function to run the model. while the 'Visualisation' file contains function with our visualisations used. (They are named accordingly)
